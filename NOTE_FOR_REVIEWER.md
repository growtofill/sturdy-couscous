# Note for Reviewer

## Completed Scope

- the data is displayed fom the url
- filtering by name and city works
- moving applicants between the stages works
- global state is kept in the context and saved to session storage

## Additional Notes

I found the timeframe for this task pretty tight, so I prefered working functionality over everything else. The only test I feel I coudn't skip is for logic to move between the stages.
